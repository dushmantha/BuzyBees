-- Fix the discount table column issue and add sample data with real provider
-- The deployment was mostly successful, just need to add the missing column and sample data

-- 1. Ensure the discount table has the code column (it should already exist)
ALTER TABLE shop_discounts ALTER COLUMN code DROP NOT NULL;

-- 2. Create the missing index (retry)
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_shop_discounts_code ON shop_discounts(code) WHERE code IS NOT NULL;

-- 3. Insert a real sample shop with the current user's provider_id (we'll use a generic one)
-- First, let's create a test provider user if needed
INSERT INTO auth.users (id, email, created_at, updated_at, email_confirmed_at)
