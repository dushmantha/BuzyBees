-- STAFF BOOKING CONFLICT DEMONSTRATION
-- ===============================================
-- This creates test bookings to demonstrate the conflict prevention system
-- 
-- COPY THIS ENTIRE SQL AND RUN IN SUPABASE SQL EDITOR

-- First, ensure we have the basic staff availability setup
-- (Make sure to run staff-database-setup-final.sql first)

-- Step 1: Add some test bookings for demonstration
-- This will show how booked time slots become unavailable

-- Get the first staff member and shop for demo
